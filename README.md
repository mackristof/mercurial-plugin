Jenkins Mercurial Plugin
=========================

This plugin is a fork that integrates the Mercurial version control system with Jenkins. See https://github.com/jenkinsci/mercurial-plugin

We want to integrate the possibility to clone/ update from a specific tag on a specific branch.

======================================

by exemple, in this case : 

![image](https://raw.github.com/mackristof/mercurial-plugin/master/exemple.png)

in this case the plugin clone the branch "3.20-REP-1.X" and then pull/update on the tag "3.20-REP-1.6"
